# Questions

If you are having problems using the product or have a question about the IBM
Watson Services, please ask a question on
[dW Answers](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/ask/?topics=watson)
or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=ibm-watson).

# Code

In an effort to have clear uniform code across a code base being developed by multiple individuals we will adopt the [Airbnb style guidelines](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

The above is provided primarily for reference and while it is encouraged reading, we will use eslint and the prettier formatter to automatically apply most of these rules.

Travis will automatically run eslint and prettier when a PR is made. However, it is a best practice to run both prettier and eslint locally to work out any issues before a PR is submitted.
